          <h3>High Craft</h3>
          <p className="mx-4">Everything we ideate, design, code, and build is custom-made with pride, which is why our client’s work boldly stands out from the clutter and the competition. Attention to detail in production and execution is just as important to us as crafting excellence in our insights, strategies, and creative concepts</p>
          <h3>Small is Bigger</h3>
          <p className="mx-4">It doesn’t take 50 people to build a site or launch a campaign, so we work smart by empowering small, multi-disciplinary teams to work closely and collaboratively in developing and executing big ideas.</p>
